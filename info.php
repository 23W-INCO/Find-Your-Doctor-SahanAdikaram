In order to make finding and scheduling healthcare appointments easier, I am working on the development 
of a cutting-edge data visualization system in the Rottal-Inn district. With the seamless integration of a 
dynamic map interface, this platform allows users to examine the geographic distribution of healthcare providers. 
In addition to standard searches, it provides a special feature for immediate communication. The system is still 
being developed, with constant efforts being made to improve its features and functionality, with the goal of giving
 residents an easy way to access healthcare services.

<br><br>As we aim to transform how people interact with healthcare providers in the area, keep an eye out for new 
features and developments." - Sahan Adikaram (Under the direction of Prof. Dr. Dominik BÃ¶hler)</h4><center>
