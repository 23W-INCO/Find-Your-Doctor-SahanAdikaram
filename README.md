# Find-Your-Doctor-
"Find your doctor easily"

In order to make finding and scheduling healthcare appointments easier, I am working on the development of a cutting-edge data visualization system in the Rottal-Inn district. With the seamless integration of a dynamic map interface, this platform allows users to examine the geographic distribution of healthcare providers. In addition to standard searches, it provides a special feature for immediate communication. The system is still being developed, with constant efforts being made to improve its features and functionality, with the goal of giving residents an easy way to access healthcare services. - Sahan Adikaram (Under the direction of Prof. Dr. Dominik BÃ¶hler)

<b>*Following the patient's submission of data, the information will be exported to an Excel file (for particular medical services), and the option for the doctor to log in and receive an instant SMS alert is still being developed. However, logging in is an option for patients to make the system more convenient and safe. Additionally, the patient's route of travel, methods for reaching their destination, and other facilities still developing*</b>
